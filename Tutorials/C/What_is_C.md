## <b> What is Structured Oriented Programming?

## <b> Why should one learn C?
  
## <b> Is it worth learning?

### One might have these questions in their mind when they start their C programming journey.

## <b> Here are the answers to a few of those questions ->
  
Structured Oriented Programming Lanaguge in a nutshell is dividing tasks which are to be performed into functions. Each function does something, however, 
a TOP down approach is followed which is an important point to keep in mind while writing the code!

If someone is coming from python or any other language, when they will run their code, they will observe that the program runs and executes much faster. This is because
very few abstraction layers are present in C. Pre Processing, conversion into assembly code (.s) and then into machine code (.o) followed by linking to create an 
exe or executable file. 
  <br> The steps involved here are very less and thus, the output is obtained VERY fast! 
  <br> One could say, the code runs at CPU level.
  <br> It is much easier to learn C++ after learning C.
  <br> Memory control is in the user's hand while programming which allows maximum performance as well as efficiency.
